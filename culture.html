        <h1><U>CULTURE OF JHARKHAND</U></h1>
        <P>Jharkhand culture is rich and diverse and as a result unique in its very own way. Jharkhand culture treats
            guests as God and serves them and takes care of them as if they are a part and parcel of the family itself.
            Archaeologists have unearthed pre-Harappa pottery, pre-historic cave paintings and rock-art from various
            parts of Jharkhand. That hint at ancient, cultured civilizations inhabiting these parts. The intricate
            woodwork, the pitkar paintings, tribal ornaments, stone carvings, dolls and figurines, masks and baskets,
            all are pointing towards the cultural wealth of Jharkhand existed even before the Harappa age. Among the
            most delicate, fragile, beautiful and threatened indigenous tradition of India are for example, the Kohvar
            and Sohrai paintings, which are sacred, secular and relevant to a woman’s world. This is the part practiced
            exclusively by married women, during weddings and at harvest time, and the skill and the information is
            handed down to younger females of the clan. Comb-cut of finger-painted Kohvar art celebrates marriage, and
            the wall-painted Sohrai, bumper crops. Elaborate design motifs, animal and plant forms, fertility motifs are
            abundant and often echo ancient cave art found in the surrounds. The colours used are all natural shades,
            red oxide from stone, red ochre, kaolin white, manganese black earth etc.</P>
