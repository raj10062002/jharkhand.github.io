        <P class="PADDING">Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo and Pandey Ganpat Rai rebelled against the British East India
            Company in the 1857

            Bhakar, Jashpur, Koriya, Surguja, and Udaipur was transferred from the Bengal government to that of the
            Central Provinces, while the two Oriya-speaking states of Gangpur and Bonai were attached to the Orissa
            Tributary States, leaving only Kharsawan and Saraikela answerable to the Bengal governor.</P>

            The dynamics of resources and the politics of development still influence the socio-economic structures in
            Jharkhand, which was carved out of the relatively underdeveloped southern part of Bihar. According to the
            1991 census, the state has a population of over 20 million out of which 28% is tribal while 12% of the
            people belong to scheduled castes. Jharkhand has 24 districts, 260 blocks, and 32,620 villages out of which
            only 45% have access to electricity while only 8,484 are connected by roads. Jharkhand is the leading
            producer of mineral wealth in the country after Chhattisgarh state, endowed as it is with a vast variety of
            minerals like iron ore, coal, copper ore, mica, bauxite, graphite, limestone, and uranium. Jharkhand is also
            known for its vast forest resources.
